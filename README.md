# Backend developer

An assistant to a professor is tasked with ensuring that students do not copy themselves when they submit essays and assignments.
Build a REST API based application that the assistant can use to compare submissions for similarity. High level:

- Assistant logs in
- The application will have 2 menu items

  - ### Compare:
    - He provides the name of the first student
    - He uploads a text file containing the content of the first student
    - He provides the name of the second student
    - He uploads a text file containing the content of the second student
    - He clicks a button to compare.
    - The system does it’s magic and presents an output stating the percentage similarity of both submissions.
    - The system may also show blocks of text as examples of how it did its comparison. If you think this helps the experience.
  - ### History:

    - He sees a table/list of all his previous comparison sessions
    - He can click anyone to see details/results
    - He can rerun anyone if he so wishes

  - ### Logout:
    - Logs him out of the application

- Create and expose an API for this activity that can be called to compare 2 submissions

### Points to note

- It’s important that the system is as performant as possible
- You are not required to build a UI interface for this task, however, a Postman collection of API queries is required.
- Your data store can be anything you are comfortable with - NoSQL or a relational database. Your choice.
  You can write your code using any Python or Javascript framework.

### What we are looking for

- Understanding of the engineering principles for building performant systems
- Creativity and simplicity of the chosen solution
- Versatility in the choice of toolset, or proficiency in your chosen toolset
- Attention to detail and elegance of the solution itself: Code quality, unit tests if any, ease of extension of the library, how clean the code is.

### How to submit

- Commit your code to a GitHub repo then share a link with us to review
- Deploy to any free cloud service of your choice, then share a link for testing
- Prepare for a follow up conversation interview where you will run us through your solution.
